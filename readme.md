# Neural Network Scratch Implementation

This project is a scratch implementation of a neural network from the ground up, written in Python. It serves as a learning resource and demonstrates how neural networks can be built without using high-level machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features

- Implements core components of a neural network:
  - Activation functions
  - Layers
  - Softmax for output probabilities
- A structured design to build and test neural networks from scratch.
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
- Modular codebase for reuse and extensibility.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Neural_Network_Scratch.git
   cd Neural_Network_Scratch
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

- **Neural Network Implementation:** Run the `neural_network.py` file to execute the main functionality of the neural network.
  ```bash
  python neural_network.py
  ```

- **Experimentation Notebooks:** Open the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory using Jupyter:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook notebooks/batch.ipynb
  ```

### Example Workflow
1. Modify the data loading script (`data.py`) to input your dataset.
2. Configure the network architecture in `layer.py` and adjust hyperparameters in `neural_network.py`.
3. Train the network and evaluate performance using the provided scripts.
